# music-recommendation
This project creates a music recommendation system that analyzes song lyrics to provide personalized recommendations based on lyrical content.
Using a dataset of song lyrics from Kaggle, text preprocessing, and TF-IDF feature extraction were applied to prepare the data. A content-based filtering approach was used to calculate song similarity based on lyrics.
The system's user interface, built with Streamlit, allows users to input songs and receive lyric-based recommendations, enhanced by album cover visuals from the Spotify API.
This approach demonstrates how natural language processing and machine learning can enhance music discovery beyond traditional metadata-based methods.
